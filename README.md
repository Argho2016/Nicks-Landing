# Nicks-Landing
In a city called Nick's Landing, there are N people (numbered 1 through N). For each valid i, the i-th person has beauty Bi and politeness Pi; no two people are equally beautiful.  You should answer Q queries. In each query you are given two integers L and R, and you should calculate Score(L,R) as defined below:          Score (L, R) :             Initialize empty Lists Q, OddQ, EvenQ             For each person with id between [L, R] :                  add his id to List Q             Sort Q in increasing order of the beauty value of the persons             Flag = 0;             For each person's id in Q :                  Flag = 1 - Flag                 If (Flag == 1) append his id to List OddQ                 Else append his id to List EvenQ               Return DiffSum (OddQ) + DiffSum (EvenQ)          DiffSum (Z[1...n]) :             Sum = 0             For i = 2 to n :                 u = Z[i]                 v = Z[i - 1]                 Sum = Sum + |P[u] - P[v]|             Return Sum
